Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

A data analyst collects, cleans, and interprets data sets in order to answer a question or solve a problem. They work in many industries, including business, finance, criminal justice, science, medicine, and government.

Python can quickly create and manage data structures, allowing you to analyze and manipulate complex data sets. Python also has a massive ecosystem of libraries and tools that can assist in processing data quickly and efficiently.
